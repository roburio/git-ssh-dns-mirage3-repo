synopsis: "State-machine-based HTTP request processor"
description: """
ocaml-webmachine is a layer on top of cohttp that implements a
state-machine-based HTTP request processor. It's particularly well-suited for
writing RESTful APIs. As the name suggests, this is an OCaml port of the
webmachine project.
